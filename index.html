            Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, fondly known as the "Missile Man of India,"
                 left an indelible mark on India's scientific, technological, and educational landscape.
            He is very simple person who lived an unpretentious lifestyle. 
                He had a keen interest in literature and wrote poems. He never married.
                 He always faced media himself for his failures while let others address for the success.
                  He remained active till the very end. He died while delivering a lecture at the IIM.
